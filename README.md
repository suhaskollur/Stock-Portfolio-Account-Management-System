## Design Patterns

The project incorporates at least two design patterns, enhancing functionality and structure.

## Usage

1. Display stock prices.
2. Manage portfolio: buy, sell, and view details.
3. Graph portfolio value over time.
4. View transaction history.
5. Bank Account transactions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/suhaskollur/Stock-Portfolio-Account-Management-System.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Stock-Portfolio-Account-Management-System

# Build and run the project
# Add specific build and run instructions if necessary
```

## Technical Details

- **Inheritance Structure:**
  - Utilizes an abstract base class (`Account`) with two derived classes (`StockAccount` and `BankAccount`).
  
- **Data Structures:**
  - Implements a doubly linked list for managing the stock portfolio.
  - Utilizes custom data structures for efficient storage.

- **Sorting Mechanism:**
  - Maintains the stock portfolio in the doubly linked list, sorted in decreasing order of total stock value.
  
- **File Handling:**
  - Stores account information, transaction history, and portfolio values in text files.
  
- **Graphical Representation:**
  - Enables users to view a graph of the portfolio value over time using MATLAB.
